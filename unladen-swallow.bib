  abstract =	 {In a virtual machine interpreter, the code for each
                  virtual machine instruction has similarities to code
                  for other instructions. We present an interpreter
                  generator that takes simple virtual machine
                  instruction descriptions as input and generates C
                  code for processing the instructions in several
                  ways: execution, virtual machine code generation,
                  disassembly, tracing, and profiling. The generator
                  is designed to support efficient interpreters: it
                  supports threaded code, caching the top-of-stack
                  item in a register, combining simple instructions
                  into superinstructions, and other optimizations. We
                  have used the generator to create interpreters for
                  Forth and Java. The resulting interpreters are
                  faster than other interpreters for the same
                  languages and they are typically 2-10 times slower
                  than code produced by native-code compilers. We also
                  present results for the effects of the individual
                  optimizations supported by the generator.}
