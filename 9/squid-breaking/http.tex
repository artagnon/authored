HTTP/1.1 (RFC 2616) defines eight methods or ``verbs'':
\begin{innerlist}
\item HEAD: Like a ping, it is used to assert the existance of a URL.
\item GET: GET is one of the most fundamental HTTP commands. It is used to get the content offered by a webserver (often a header along with a HTML dump).
\item POST
\item PUT
\item DELETE
\item TRACE
\item OPTIONS
\item CONNECT
\end{innerlist}

HTTP/1.0 (RFC 1945) defines only the first three methods. The rest are only available in HTTP/1.1. Of these, CONNECT is of primary interest to us. The CONNECT command can be used to connect to arbirary ports, often used to perform SSL authentication.
