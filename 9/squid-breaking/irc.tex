IRC is such a bitch behind proxies that I thought I should dedicate a whole section to it. The #1 problem is that most IRC networks do not allow anyone and everyone to connect to them. It's understandable as they're hammered with a lot of spam everyday and need to take effective measures to prevent this.

The solution: Route it through some random proxy on the internet that the IRC network doesn't necessarily recognize. The principle of anonimity: Chain togther a huge number of anonymous proxies (proxies that don't care who you are, and won't record it).
